    Filter::Handle.pm

This module allows you to apply arbitrary filters to output
filehandles. You can perform any sorts of transformations on
the outgoing text: you can prepend it with data, you can
replace all instances of one word with another, etc.

It has three different interfaces: functional, tie, and
object-oriented. You can use whichever you like.
